# RealTime-3D-Face-Mesh
A better approach following one of my classic repos ðŸ™„

## Well, the old pipeline...
1. Facial keypoints estimator (dlib 68 points detector).
2. Fine grained image depth estimator.
3. A little of geometry magic for visualization.

## The new one!
1. Turns out the mediapipe facial keypoints estimator estimates waaay more keypoints and its depth .......
2. A little of geometry magic for visualization.


I still like the first one since was my main idea, but you gotta know when you are defeated.
